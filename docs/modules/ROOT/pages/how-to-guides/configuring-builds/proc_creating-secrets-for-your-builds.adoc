= Creating secrets for your builds 

When you building your pipelines, you might want to add tasks that require *secrets* in order to access external resources.

NOTE: One such task is the link:https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/tree/main/task/sast-snyk-check[sast-snyk-check] task that that uses the third-party service link:https://snyk.io/[snyk] to perform static application security testing (SAST) as a part of the default {ProductName} pipeline. Use this procedure to upload your snyk.io token. Name the secret `sast_snyk_task` so that the snyk task in the {ProductName} pipeline will recognize it and use it.

.Procedure 

. In {ProductName}, from the left navigation menu, select **Secrets**.
. From the **Secrets** page, click **Add secret**.
. From the **Add secret** page, choose what stage of your application's development you want to create a secret for: **Build** or **Deployment**.
. Select a secret type:
    * **Key/value secret**
    * **Image pull secret**
    * **Source secret**
. For **Secret name**, enter a unique name for your secret.
. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 1**, then enter a key.
. For **Upload the file with value for your key or paste its contents**, do one of the following:
    * Click **Upload** to browse to, select, and upload the file that contains your key value.
    * Drag the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
    * Paste the contents of the file that contains your key value into the space under **Upload**.
  Click **Clear** to remove the contents of the space under **Upload**.
. Optional: Click **Add another key/value**.
. Optional: Under **Labels**, add a label to tag or provide more context for your secret.
. Click **Add secret**.


Alternatively, you can use the `oc` command to create a build secret for source code management tools such as
GitHub or GitLab manually.
For example, to create a secret for the gitlab.com holding a personal access token, use the following secret format:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pipelines-as-code-secret
  namespace: <YOUR NAMESPACE>
  labels:
    appstudio.redhat.com/credentials: scm
    appstudio.redhat.com/scm.host: <gitlab-host> # eg. gitlab.cee.redhat.com
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  password: <PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>
----

[NOTE]
====
Using the PAT authentication requires only the `password` key. The `username` should not be set.
If you will set both `username` and `password` keys, the authentication type will be considered as `basic`, so
basic auth client will be created using those credentials, which may not work (or considered as deprecated login method)
with some SCM providers.
====

This secret will be used by build service to perform both "Simple" and "Pipeline-as-Code" builds.
